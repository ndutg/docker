#HOW TO ADD DOCKER ON CODE-SERVER
If you've already mounted the docker sock, you just need to exec into the code-server container;

docker exec -it code-server /bin/bash

and install the Docker CLI;

apt-get update
apt-get install -y docker.io
then install the Docker extension and it will work.

Note: The Docker CLI will not persist between container restarts. For that you could roll your own or use the LinuxServer.io image with the DOCKER_MODS: "linuxserver/mods:universal-docker" env var set.
